# Data Structures and Algorithms 

DS&A related stuff for my own studying and understanding. Trying to use and learn Typescript and Jest tests at the same time.

If you wish `git clone git@github.com:alejo4373/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms` then `cd Data-Structures-And-Algorithms && npm install`.

#### Run Tests

```
npm test
```
> Compilation happens automatically

To run any code manually compile Typescript to Javascript executing `tsc` and note that a `/build` folder will be created with the compiled code. Then execute with `node` as usual the compiled version of the code.
