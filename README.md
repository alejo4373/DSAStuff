# DSAStuff
DSA related stuff for my own studying and understanding. Trying to implement Typescript features and Jest tests at the same time.

If you wish `git clone git@github.com:alejo4373/DSAStuff.git` then `cd DSAStuff && npm install`.

To compile Typescript to Javascript (optional) execute `tsc` and note that a `/build` folder will be created with the compiled code.

Lastly check if the tests pass by running `npm test`
